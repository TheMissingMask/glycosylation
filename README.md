#### Python code written for DPhil work

This code was developed as a method to add sugar chains to protein structures, incorporating a degree of randomisation to the sugar units added and their length.  At the time of writing it was functional for N- and O-linked glycan chains, and indivudual sugar units.  Further development would be necessary to extend to other glycosylation types.
